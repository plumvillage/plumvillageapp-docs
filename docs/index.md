# Plum Village App Dev Docs

Welcome to the developer documentation for the [Plum Village App](https://plumvillage.app), a mobile application supporting mindfulness and meditation practices in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and Plum Village.

## About the Project

The Plum Village App provides guided meditations, teachings, and mindfulness resources to practitioners worldwide. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for developers contributing to the project.

The documentation covers code in many repositories, some of which are private. The documentation is therefore not yet useful for the general public, but we hope it will be more useful in the future once we make more of the code public.
