# Plum Village App Documentation

Developer documentation for the Plum Village App, a mobile application supporting mindfulness and meditation practices in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh and Plum Village.

This documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The documentation covers code in many repositories, some of which are private. The documentation is therefore not yet useful for the general public, but we hope it will be more useful in the future once we make more of the code public.

## View Live Documentation

The documentation is automatically deployed and available at: [https://plumvillage.github.io/plumvillageapp-docs/](https://plumvillage.github.io/plumvillageapp-docs/)

Note: this is not yet enabled but we plan to soon.

## About

The Plum Village App provides guided meditations, teachings, and mindfulness resources to practitioners worldwide. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for developers contributing to the project.

## Prerequisites

- Yarn package manager

## Getting Started
